# beast_mode_videolyzer
The purpose of this repo is build a video analyzer that ingests videos of workouts and provides statistics to track which movements allow for the best and most efficient progress over time base on anthropometry.

Inspired by Next Gen Stats, I thought it was pretty sweet to be able to provide a new dimension of statistical information that could help identify areas and progress efficiently.

# step one

- I will be leveraging Amazon Rekognition to see what kind of information I can get with it.

# current progress.

- using ipython to interactively use recognition service.
- created bucket to upload videos to.
- tested calls outputs to see what data would be useful to parse for later use.
- details of call can be seen in the 'beast.py' file
